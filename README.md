# SmarDe's@Work

Smart Devices (such as Smartphones and Smart Watches) offer many options to support production processes, such as optimization or worker assistance. So far, neither implementation recommendations nor standardized APIs exist. The project SmarDeÂ´s@Work aims at usefully utilizing Smart Devices in the production area. In the foreground stands the connection of different production participants, such as workers, machines and information systems. The right combination of software and hardware through interactive and intuitive information processing supports the work preparation as well as the actual production and thereby generates efficiency along with raising optimization potentials. In order to ensure a broad applicability for different companies with different processes and IT-infrastructures, it would be required to integrate data from any information system such as ERP, MES or quality management. 

As a result, a central component of the project is the development of a middleware combined with client applications for different smart devices. This solution aims at linking smart devices to the existing production systems. This approach reduces integration hurdles of utilizing smart devices and ensures the transferability to varied use cases. In addition, the use of smart devices offers the option of a time and place independent production control. Production processes are digitally optimized, quality monitoring, control and guarantee based on real time date are implemented, and an Industry 4.0 required process flexibility reached.
